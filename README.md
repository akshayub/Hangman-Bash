# Hangman-Bash
Hangman game using Bash scripting

This is a mini-project for the course IT202 : Unix programming and practice, for 2nd year IT at NITK-Surathkal.

It is a guessing game.

Presently, only English Movies, Hindi Movies, and American English word lists are pre-built.
There is an option to make the game use your own list.
  Make sure that each guessing object is in a separate line. For samples, see the files 'movies', 'bollywood'.
